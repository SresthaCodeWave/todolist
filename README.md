# to-do list
It is a beautiful list where you can check off your to-do list items and add items to your existing lists.
You can also create multiple lists in the website. You have to click on the url and a name of your new list beside "/" .
Express routing parameters are used to create dynamic routes through which we can create and accept multiple lists.
